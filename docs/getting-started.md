## Prerequisites

Python 3.5+


## Installation

You can install stream-read-xbrl and its dependencies from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/stream-read-xbrl/) using pip.

```bash
pip install stream-read-xbrl
```

This installs the latest version of stream-read-xbrl, and the latest compatible version of all of its dependencies.

If you regularly install stream-read-xbrl, such as during application deployment, to avoid unexpected changes as new versions are released, you can pin to specific versions. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are popular tools that can be used for this.


## Usage

### OLD CONTENT KEPT FOR REFERENCE
A single function is exposed, `stream_unzip`, that takes a single argument: an iterable that should yield the bytes of a ZIP file [with no zero-length chunks]. It returns an iterable, where each yielded item is a tuple of the file name, file size [`None` if this is not known], and another iterable itself yielding the unzipped bytes of that file.

```python
from stream_unzip import stream_unzip
import httpx

def zipped_chunks():
    # Iterable that yields the bytes of a zip file
    with httpx.stream('GET', 'https://www.example.com/my.zip') as r:
        yield from r.iter_bytes(chunk_size=65536)

for file_name, file_size, unzipped_chunks in stream_unzip(zipped_chunks(), password=b'my-password'):
    # unzipped_chunks must be iterated to completion or UnfinishedIterationError will be raised
    for chunk in unzipped_chunks:
        print(chunk)
```

The file name and file size are extracted as reported from the file. If you don't trust the creator of the ZIP file, these should be treated as untrusted input.
